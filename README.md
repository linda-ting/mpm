My implementation of the material point method; developed from scratch as coursework for CIS 563: Physically Based Simulation (F20).

To compile and run:

1. Execute `make all`
2. To run cube simulation, execute `./material_point 0`
3. The output frames will be saved to the `output` folder
4. Use `rendering.hipnc` to render and visualize frames in Houdini

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d4vvgMemeKOzZZ3XftQVzDIjb8YejMwG/view?usp=sharing) is a rendered demo of a jello cube simulated with 100,000 particles.
